INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

You need CMake to compile cHealpix from source code. Once you've
installed it, enter the source directory and run the following
commands:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. && make

To install the library on your system, run

    make install

within the "build" directory you created before.

To keep "release" and "debug" build separated, run the following:

    for type in Release Debug; do
        mkdir $type
        cd $type
        cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=$type .. && make
        cd ..
    done

(this runs under Bash).
